# JS-Basic
I'm converting this repo in a tiny set and reusable js interfaces for diferent purposes. Some of them are:

1.-Reusable components with any kind of framework or library like Angular or React.js.
2.-Being a better JS, HTML & CSS developer.
3.- Sharing some good code with this and other comunities and so on.
